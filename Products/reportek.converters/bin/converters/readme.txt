For CentOS, we have installed from yum:

  yum install gd
  yum install fribidi
  yum install fcgi
  yum install wv
  yum install p7zip
  yum install mdbtools
  yum install gdal

Also, we installed the following rpms (we kept them in converters folder for future installations):
gd-2.0.35-10.el6.x86_64.rpm
mapserver-6.0.1-2.el6.x86_64.rpm
unrar-4.1.4-1.el6.rf.x86_64.rpm
xgawk-3.1.6-0.1.20080101.5m.mo6.x86_64.rpm
xlhtml-0.5-11.puias6.x86_64.rpm


Also we had to install python module pyshapelib, for dbflib... it was hard to find :)

You need shapelib (yum install shapelib) but also the shapelib sources (read the pyshapelib installation)
